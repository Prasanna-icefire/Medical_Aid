This is app is a chatbot that i created with the help of dialogflow.
This aims at communicating with the mentally and emotionally challenged people who are under isolation

The login page is a dummy as of now.Yet to connect with firebase.

To use this as a flutter Project, simply git clone this repository.
Go to dialogflow's official website and create an agent along with either a new or existing google project.
Then hed to the projects repo of Google and under credentials | services create your json file and download it.
rename this Json as credss.json and add it into the assets folder. Then build and run the app.

Happy coding!
